# InfraRadar AI - Revised Financial Model

## Document Purpose

This document provides a realistic financial model for InfraRadar AI based on the freemium model strategy, narrow wedge focus, and revised pricing tiers. It includes detailed revenue projections, cost analysis, and unit economics for the first two years of operation.

## Executive Summary

Our revised financial model assumes a freemium approach with realistic pricing tiers ($6K-$60K vs. original $50K-$500K), narrow wedge focus on MENA data centers + renewables, and human-in-the-loop verification. Target ARR: $1.5M by Year 1, $3.5M by Year 2.

**Key Changes**: Lower pricing, higher gross margins through cost optimization, freemium conversion model, and realistic customer acquisition assumptions.
