## Execution Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-30)

**Objective**: Build MVP and establish validation framework

**Key Activities**:

- Narrow wedge scope definition (MENA data centers + renewables)
- Canonical schema design for target vertical
- High-signal data source identification
- Domain expert analyst hiring
- Confidence scoring algorithm design
- Thin-slice MVP build with HITL verification
- Salesforce integration implementation
- Pilot project loading and verification

**Success Criteria**:

- MVP built with core features
- 2 domain expert analysts hired
- 20-30 pilot projects loaded and verified
- Analyst workflow tools operational

### Phase 2: Validation (Days 31-60)

**Objective**: Validate market demand and willingness to pay

**Key Activities**:

- Lighthouse user identification and contact
- Pilot agreement negotiation and signing
- Customer onboarding process testing
- Initial usage pattern establishment
- Feedback collection system implementation
- Pilot-to-paying customer conversion
- Pricing tier validation through customer feedback
- Payment processing setup

**Success Criteria**:

- 3 lighthouse users identified and contacted
- ≥2 pilots converted to paying customers
- Customer onboarding process validated
- Payment processing operational

### Phase 3: Scale Preparation (Days 61-90)

**Objective**: Optimize and prepare for scaling

**Key Activities**:

- Kill criteria metrics optimization
- Customer feedback incorporation into product
- Data quality and freshness improvement
- Analyst workflow optimization
- Partnership pipeline establishment
- Clear path to scale identification
- Team confidence assessment
- Funding strategy definition

**Success Criteria**:

- All primary kill criteria met
- Clear path to scale identified
- Team confident in product-market fit
- Expansion plan created

## Kill Criteria (Non-Negotiable)

### Primary Kill Criteria

1. **Paying Pilots**: ≥2 customers paying €2-5K each by Day 90
2. **Weekly Active Usage**: ≥70% among pilot users
3. **Data Freshness**: <14 days median for watchlist projects
4. **Revenue Validation**: €10K+ total pilot revenue

### Secondary Success Indicators

1. **Customer Satisfaction**: ≥4.0/5.0 rating
2. **Data Accuracy**: ≥90% on critical fields
3. **Feature Adoption**: ≥50% using core features

## Decision Framework

### Go Decision Criteria

- 80%+ of customers validate problem severity
- 3+ customers commit to paid pilots
- Clear path to €10K pilot revenue in 90 days
- Differentiation validated vs. competitors
- Pricing validated with real customer budgets

### No-Go Decision Criteria

- <50% of customers see problem as severe
- <2 customers willing to pay for pilots
- Competitors can easily replicate differentiation
- Data quality cannot meet customer expectations
- Market timing not right for solution

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks

- Cannot achieve <14 day data freshness with current architecture
- Data quality issues cannot be resolved with HITL approach
- Technical complexity exceeds team capabilities
- Integration requirements too complex for target customers

### Market Risks

- Target customers not willing to pay for solution
- Competitive landscape changes significantly
- Regulatory changes affect data access
- Market size smaller than expected

### Team Risks

- Key team members leave
- Cannot hire required domain experts
- Team lacks skills for technical challenges
- Burnout or motivation issues

## Contingency Plans

### Plan A: 30-Day Extension

**Conditions**: 1-2 criteria missed, clear path to improvement
**Actions**: Focus all resources on missed criteria, weekly check-ins, clear success metrics

### Plan B: Pivot to Consulting

**Conditions**: Market validation fails, but domain expertise valuable
**Actions**: Offer "Infrastructure Market Intelligence Reports" as service, maintain team

### Plan C: Pivot to Data Provider

**Conditions**: Product too complex, but data valuable
**Actions**: Simplify to data feed/API model, focus on data quality and freshness

### Plan D: Shut Down

**Conditions**: No viable pivot path, market not there
**Actions**: Return remaining capital, document learnings, help team find new opportunities
