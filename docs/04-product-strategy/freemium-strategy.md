# InfraRadar AI - Freemium Model Strategy

## Document Purpose

This document defines the freemium model strategy for InfraRadar AI, including free tier specifications, paid tier features, conversion funnel design, and lead capture approach. The freemium model is designed to validate market demand while building a sustainable revenue base.

## Executive Summary

Our freemium strategy centers on the "Africa Megaprojects Tracker" as a free, public-facing tool that captures leads and validates demand. Free users get access to 50-100 largest projects (>$500M) with basic data, while paid tiers offer real-time updates, CRM integration, and analyst access.
