## Pricing Validation Questions

### Budget Availability Questions

   - "What's your typical budget for business intelligence software?"
   - "How much would you spend on a solution that solved your biggest pain point?"

2. **Budget Process Questions**

   - "Who approves software purchases in your organization?"
   - "What's the typical approval process for tools like this?"
   - "How long does budget approval usually take?"
   - "What's the maximum amount you can approve without higher-level approval?"

3. **Value Perception Questions**
   - "If this solution saved you 10 hours per week, what would that be worth?"
   - "What's the cost of missing one major project opportunity?"
   - "How much would you pay to reduce project risk by 50%?"

### Pricing Sensitivity Testing

#### Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter

**Question 1**: "At what price would you consider this solution too expensive to consider?"
**Question 2**: "At what price would you consider this solution too cheap to be of good quality?"
**Question 3**: "At what price would you consider this solution expensive but still worth considering?"
**Question 4**: "At what price would you consider this solution a bargain?"

#### Conjoint Analysis Questions

**Scenario Testing**: Present different feature combinations at different price points

- Basic features at $6K vs. Premium features at $24K
- CRM integration value assessment
- Analyst support value perception

### Competitive Pricing Questions

1. **Current Solution Comparison**

   - "What do you currently pay for [competitor solution]?"
   - "How does our pricing compare to what you expected?"
   - "What would make you switch from your current solution?"

2. **Value-Based Pricing**
   - "What's the ROI you'd need to see to justify this investment?"
   - "How many successful projects would this need to identify to pay for itself?"
   - "What's the cost of not having this information?"
