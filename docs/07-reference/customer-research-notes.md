# InfraRadar AI - Customer Research Notes

## Document Purpose

This document consolidates comprehensive customer research insights, methodologies, and findings from InfraRadar AI's customer discovery process.

## Executive Summary

Before building anything, we need to deeply understand who our real customers are and what pain points they face. Successful founders often spend more time on customer discovery than on coding early on. This document outlines our comprehensive customer research and outreach plan to validate our assumptions about who will use our solution, what problems we're solving for them, and how to reach and engage these people effectively.

## Customer Research Methodology

### Research Objectives

- Identify exactly who our real customers are
- Uncover their deepest pain points and challenges
- Understand their current solutions and workarounds
- Map their decision-making processes and buying criteria
- Develop targeted messaging and sales strategies

### Research Approach

#### Volume of Interviews

To ensure we have reliable insights, we will talk to as many potential customers as possible. Anecdotal feedback from just a handful of people can be misleading. Experts note that until you've done on the order of 100 customer discovery interviews, your market understanding is just a set of unproven hypotheses.

**Target**: ~100 conversations across both customer groups combined to give us enough data to confidently identify the real pain points and needs.

#### Interview Structure

- **Duration**: 15-30 minutes per interview
- **Format**: Open-ended questions focused on customer experience
- **Goal**: Customer talks 90% of the time about their needs, while we listen and probe deeper
- **Approach**: Focus on customer's experience and challenges, not on pitching our product idea

### Key Research Questions

#### Problem Discovery Questions

- "What is the biggest challenge with [problem area]?"
- "What do you currently do when [specific situation]?"
- "Why is that hard?"
- "What would a perfect solution allow you to do?"
- "How often does this problem occur?"
- "What impact does this have on your business?"

#### Current Solution Questions

- "How do you currently solve this problem?"
- "What tools or processes do you use?"
- "What are the limitations of your current approach?"
- "What workarounds have you developed?"
- "How much time/money does this cost you?"

#### Decision-Making Questions

- "Who else is involved in decisions about [problem area]?"
- "What criteria do you use to evaluate solutions?"
- "What's your budget for solving this problem?"
- "How long does it typically take to make these decisions?"
- "What would need to happen for you to switch solutions?"

## Target Customer Segments

- Have the problem and know they have it
- Are actively seeking a solution
- Feel the pain point acutely and urgently
- Are willing to try new solutions
- Can provide honest feedback and insights

## Customer Pain Points

### Hypothesized Pain Points

Based on our initial analysis, we suspect customers face these core challenges:

#### Information Asymmetry

- **Problem**: Lack of reliable, up-to-date project information
- **Impact**: Missed opportunities, poor decision-making
- **Current Solutions**: Manual research, multiple data sources
- **Limitations**: Time-consuming, inconsistent, outdated

#### Risk Uncertainty

- **Problem**: Difficulty assessing project risks and delays
- **Impact**: Cost overruns, project failures, investment losses
- **Current Solutions**: Manual risk assessment, historical data
- **Limitations**: Reactive, not predictive, limited data

#### Missed Opportunities

- **Problem**: Missing project opportunities due to lack of intelligence
- **Impact**: Lost revenue, competitive disadvantage
- **Current Solutions**: Manual monitoring, industry networks
- **Limitations**: Incomplete coverage, delayed information

#### Due Diligence Costs

- **Problem**: Slow, expensive due diligence processes
- **Impact**: Delayed decisions, increased costs
- **Current Solutions**: Manual research, external consultants
- **Limitations**: Time-consuming, expensive, inconsistent

#### Data Quality Issues

- **Problem**: Unreliable, outdated, or unverified project data
- **Impact**: Poor decisions, lost trust, wasted resources
- **Current Solutions**: Multiple sources, manual verification
- **Limitations**: Inconsistent quality, no confidence scoring

### Pain Point Validation Process

#### Document Pain Points & Severity

As we conduct interviews, we will document each pain point mentioned and how severe it is for the customer. We expect patterns to emerge:

- **Severity Rating**: 1-5 scale (1 = minor inconvenience, 5 = critical business impact)
- **Frequency**: Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly
- **Quantifiable Impact**: Time lost, money spent, opportunities missed
- **Current Workarounds**: How customers currently cope with the problem

#### Prioritize the Core Problem

By the end of our interviews, we aim to identify the one or two core pain points that are:

- Most common across our target audience
- Severe enough that people will readily pay for a solution
- Not adequately solved by current alternatives
- Aligned with our solution capabilities

## Customer Outreach Strategy

### Outreach Channels

#### Personal and Professional Networks

- **Approach**: Start with who we know
- **Method**: Send short outreach email describing project and asking for 15-minute discovery interviews
