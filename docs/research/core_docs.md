mosaic.tech
+1
	Articles of incorporation, share structure, IP filings (if any), data/privacy compliance (especially for AI/data products).
Product/Technology Documentation	Since InfraRader is AI-powered and data-rich, you‚Äôll need technical documentation (for investors, partners) and possibly a product demo.	Architecture overview, data pipeline, agent/extraction flow, verification process; maybe a minimum viable prototype or mock-up.
Go-to-Market Plan & Customer Journey	The landing page will reference this, so you need it ready so messaging aligns.	Customer personas, acquisition channels, pricing strategy, first-adopter outreach plan.
Data Room / Due Diligence Deck	When you approach strategic partners or investors, you‚Äôll need a repository of deeper materials. 
Y Combinator
+1
	Market research, competitor analysis, risk logs, cap table, key contracts (if any pilot/POC), traction metrics.
Landing Page Content & Visual Assets	Before building the landing page, you need credible content so you don‚Äôt ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù prematurely with thin material.	Taglines, hero banner visuals, product demo/screenshot, testimonials or early-adopter quotes (if any), wait-list signup form, privacy policy/terms.
Branding & Messaging Guidelines	A consistent brand and messaging is important ‚Äî especially for website, deck, marketing.	Name (e.g., ‚ÄúInfraRader‚Äù), logo, colour palette, fonts, tone of voice.
Data Privacy / Compliance Framework	Since you‚Äôre dealing with large project data, AI, geospatial imagery ‚Äî there are compliance and privacy issues especially across jurisdictions.	Data usage policy, privacy statement, GDPR/EU compliance, partner terms.
ü§ñ Special Considerations in the Era of AI

Because InfraRader‚Äôs proposition is AI‚Äêpowered, there are a few ‚ÄúAI-era‚Äù specific documents/assets to prepare:

Model & Data Governance Brief: Document how your AI agents work, how you handle bias, reliability, verification, how you maintain provenance of data. This builds trust for partners who rely on your intelligence.

Ethics & Data Usage Policy: Especially if you use satellite/alt-data, or aggregate project info from many sources, you should clarify how you source data, how you verify it, and how clients can rely on it.

Tech Stack Architecture Diagram: A visual diagram that shows how your data pipelines, AI agents, visualization layers, and user interface connect. Useful for technical audiences and investors.

Security & Access Protocols: For data-heavy products, you may need to outline how you protect user/project data, how clients access the platform, what SLAs you‚Äôll provide.

Pilot / MVP Case Study or Proof-of-Concept Plan: Since you‚Äôre early stage, showing or documenting your first customer or pilot scenario will add credibility. You can outline how you‚Äôll onboard your first 2-3 paying clients, what metrics you‚Äôll track, and what success means.

API/Integration Strategy (if relevant): If you plan to offer integrations (CRM, ERP, GIS systems) you should have a document outlining how your product will embed into clients‚Äô workflows ‚Äî APIs, data export formats, plugin/connector.

Data Licensing & Terms of Use: As a business intelligence product, you will have to define the terms under which clients consume your data, what usage rights they get, any data refresh SLAs, etc.

üß≠ Suggested Priority for What to Complete Before Building the Landing Page

Finalise branding/messaging guidelines (so the landing page reflects your identity)

Write the hero messaging & value proposition for the site (these should tie back to your pitch deck & canvas)

Prepare a one-pager (executive summary) which can be downloadable from the landing page (for leads/investors)

Have the pricing strategy and first tier offering defined (so you can publish ‚ÄúJoin the wait-list for Early Access ‚Äì Pilot pricing: ‚Ç¨X/month‚Äù)

Prepare at least minimal visual assets (logo, hero image, maybe a short explainer video or gif)

Draft privacy policy / terms for your landing page (since you‚Äôll be collecting email leads)

Set up wait-list sign-up form and CRM/lead capture mechanism (e.g., MailChimp, HubSpot, Google Form)

Have ready the MVP/pilot proposition ‚Äî so when leads come in, you can respond immediately with a follow-up email: ‚ÄúThank you for joining our waitlist. Here‚Äôs how you will be involved in the pilot‚Ä¶‚Äù.

‚úÖ Bottom Line

Yes ‚Äî you have the big pieces covered (canvas, pitch deck, business plan) but to build a landing page that performs and aligns with your full start-up story, you‚Äôll want to fill out the full suite of documents above.
Because you‚Äôre offering an AI tool in infrastructure intelligence, preparation around trust, data governance, technical architecture and pilot readiness becomes even more important.

Once you‚Äôve ticked off the above checklist, you‚Äôll be in an excellent position to launch your landing page, collect leads, and convert early adopters confidently.
I can help you prioritise which documents to finish first (for example, for your upcoming accelerator or pilot outreach), and build templates for each. Would you like me to prepare those templates now (e.g., executive summary, data governance brief, pilot onboarding plan)?
