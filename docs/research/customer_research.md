Comprehensive Customer Research & Outreach Plan

Before we build anything, we need to deeply understand who our real customers are and what pain points they face. Successful founders often spend more time on customer discovery than on coding early on. For example, serial entrepreneur Steven Cohn spoke with over 300 companies before building his product – these conversations helped him narrow down the target audience and define an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
jeffgothelf.com
. Inspired by this approach, we will conduct thorough customer research to validate our assumptions about who will use our solution, what problems we’re solving for them, and how to reach and engage these people effectively.

Identifying Our Real Customers

Based on our discussions and co-founder insights, we hypothesize two main customer groups (both are important): Group A and Group B (for instance, both individual end-users and business clients, or both sides of a marketplace). Rather than choosing one too early, we’ll explore both segments to discover where the strongest need and fit truly lies. Each interview and data point will help us refine our target and pinpoint who our real early adopters are.

Ideal Customer Profile (ICP): Through outreach and interviews, our goal is to identify the characteristics of customers who truly need our solution. As Cohn’s experience showed, each conversation can narrow the focus toward the ideal customer
jeffgothelf.com
. We expect to iteratively refine criteria like the customer’s role, industry, size, or demographic until we converge on those most likely to benefit from and pay for our product.

Users vs. Buyers: If our platform is B2B or multi-sided, we must distinguish between the end users of the product and the buyers/decision-makers. Often, the people using a product are not the ones authorizing the purchase. Users care about features, whereas buyers care about value and ROI
blog.squadra.vc
. We will identify both: the pain points of end users and the motivations of the economic buyers (the managers or stakeholders who would approve spending). This ensures our solution appeals to both groups. It doesn’t matter how great a product is if we can’t convince the buyer of its value
blog.squadra.vc
, so our research will cover both perspectives.

Early Adopters Focus: Initially, we will target “early adopters” in our customer segments. Early adopters are those who have the problem, know they have it, and are actively seeking a solution
customerdevlabs.com
. They feel the pain point acutely and urgently. Finding such people is critical – if we can’t find anyone actively looking for a fix to the problem we solve, it’s a sign the market timing may be off
customerdevlabs.com
. By contrast, if we do find them, there’s a great fit: we need them (for feedback and early traction) and they need us (to solve their problem)
customerdevlabs.com
. These are the folks most likely to give us honest insights and eventually become our first users.

Action plan: We will list out the attributes of our assumed customer groups (from previous discussions) – for example, if Group A is small e-commerce business owners and Group B is frequent online shoppers (just as an illustrative example) – and then seek out individuals who match these profiles. We’ll remain open-minded: the discovery process might reveal a more specific niche within “both” groups that really needs our solution. Our research will zero in on those sub-groups as we learn more.

Understanding Their Pain Points

Identifying what problems our customers need solved is our next priority. We suspect the core pain point involves [specific problem] (as discussed earlier), but we need to validate how exactly this pain manifests for customers, and which aspect is most painful.

Ask the Right Questions: In customer discovery interviews, we will focus on the customer’s experience and challenges, not on pitching our product idea. We want to uncover their pain points, desires, current behaviors, and how they currently solve (or struggle with) the problem
blog.squadra.vc
. It’s important to let them do the talking – ideally the customer talks 90% of the time about their needs, while we listen and probe deeper
blog.squadra.vc
. We must resist the urge to “sell” our solution during these conversations. Even if they describe exactly the problem we hope to solve, we will not jump in with a sales pitch or bias the conversation toward our product
blog.squadra.vc
. The moment we start selling, we lose the chance to get unbiased, accurate insight into their real needs
blog.squadra.vc
. Our goal is to learn, so we’ll use open-ended questions (e.g. “What is the biggest challenge with…?”, “What do you currently do when…?”, “Why is that hard?”, “What would a perfect solution allow you to do?”). We’ll also ask follow-ups to dig into why those issues matter – for instance, if a pain point “keeps them up at night” or costs them time or money, that indicates a critical problem worth solving.

Document Pain Points & Severity: As we conduct these interviews, we will document each pain point mentioned and how severe it is for the customer. We expect patterns to emerge. For example, we might find that both Group A and Group B dislike the current process of X, but Group A finds it merely inconvenient while Group B finds it extremely costly and frustrating (or vice-versa). Such insight tells us where our solution will add the most value. We’ll note any “workarounds” people use today – if customers have invented clumsy hacks to solve the issue, it signals an unmet need. We’ll also note the frequency of the problem (daily pain is more urgent than monthly pain) and any quantifiable impacts (e.g. “This problem costs me 5 hours a week” or “I lose $500 a month because of this issue”).

Prioritize the Core Problem: By the end of our interviews, we aim to identify the one or two core pain points that are most common and critical for our target customers. These are the problems our platform must solve first. In other words, we’re looking for the pain point that is both widespread in our target audience and severe enough that people will readily pay for a solution. The discussion insights will guide what our value proposition should focus on – i.e. how exactly our solution will relieve their pain in a way current alternatives do not.

Volume of Interviews: To ensure we have reliable insights, we will talk to as many potential customers as possible. Anecdotal feedback from just a handful of people can be misleading. In fact, experts note that until you’ve done on the order of 100 customer discovery interviews, your market understanding is just a set of unproven hypotheses
blog.squadra.vc
. We should strive to gather a large sample of opinions so that we can distinguish true trends from one-off remarks. Hitting a target of ~100 conversations (across both customer groups combined) will give us enough data to confidently identify the real pain points and needs
blog.squadra.vc
. This might sound like a lot, but investing a few weeks to interview dozens of people now can save us months of building the wrong thing. It’s far cheaper and faster to learn through conversation than to build a product no one actually wants.

Synthesize Findings: We will regularly pause to synthesize what we’re hearing. If many interviews in a row point to the same pain point, that’s a strong signal. If we hear conflicting feedback (e.g. one segment cares about speed, another about cost), we’ll note that and possibly decide to focus on the segment with the more urgent need. The end result will be a clear description of our target customer and their primary pain point(s). For example, we might end up with a statement like: “Our real customer is [X persona] who struggles with [Y problem], and currently they cope by [current solution] which is frustrating because [limitations].” This will directly inform how we pitch our solution and what features to build first.

Reaching Out and Engaging Potential Users

To gather this insight, we need to actually get in touch with potential customers. We will cast a wide net across all platforms and channels accessible to us – essentially any avenue that can connect us with early adopters or early users (as you advised, “All platforms as long as we can get to a potential user or an early adopter”). Here are the outreach methods we’ll employ:

Leverage Personal and Professional Networks: We will start with who we know. We’ll tell friends, colleagues, mentors, and our extended network about the type of people we’re looking to speak with. A practical approach is to send a short outreach email to our contacts describing our project and asking for 15-minute discovery interviews with specific types of people (e.g. “We’re looking to speak with [titles/roles] who experience [problem] – this is for research, not a sales call”). We can include a scheduling link to make it easy. Our contacts might introduce us to relevant people. This warm referral approach can yield quality conversations quickly

. Even our investors (if any) or mentors can tap their networks to connect us with target customers
jeffgothelf.com
.

Cold Outreach on LinkedIn: For B2B or professional targets, LinkedIn is invaluable. We will identify individuals by job title, industry, or keywords and reach out with a personalized connection and message. Expect a low response rate to cold LinkedIn messages – in Cohn’s experience, pure cold outreach had a relatively low success rate
jeffgothelf.com
. Nonetheless, even a few responses can get the ball rolling. We’ll keep the message short and respectful of their time (emphasizing we’re doing research and value their insight). Over time, as we refine our message and perhaps gain some referrals, our hit rate should improve.

Cold Emails (and Calls): We will also send cold emails to potential users or decision-makers. If we can find email addresses (via company websites, hunter.io, or other tools), a brief email can work similar to the LinkedIn script – introduce ourselves, state we are researching [problem area], and politely ask if they’d be willing to share their experience. We might use a subject line that piques interest (but not spammy). For certain customer types (e.g. small local businesses), cold calling by phone or even in-person visits can be effective, since these customers may not respond to email. We’ll prepare a short “pitch” for why we’re calling (again, emphasizing this is to learn about their needs, not a sales solicitation). Not everyone will respond, but persistence is key. Cold emailing remains a viable way to get early customers engaged – even if response rates are modest (~14% click-to-open on average), it’s still an important channel, especially for B2B startups
trevor.io
. We will send a manageable batch of emails each week and follow up once if there’s no response.

Social Media and Direct Messages: Depending on where our target customers hang out, we will use platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, or specialized forums. For instance, if our customer is a software developer, we might find them on Twitter or Stack Overflow; if our customer is a young consumer, maybe Instagram or TikTok groups; if they are designers, perhaps certain Facebook or Discord communities. We will join relevant groups or conversations and look for people discussing the problem we solve. A gentle direct message commenting on their post and asking if they’d be open to chatting can work. The key is to be genuine and not come across as a spammer. We’ll tailor our approach to each platform’s etiquette.

Industry Communities and Forums: Many professions or interest groups have dedicated online communities (Slack channels, subreddits, Discord servers, LinkedIn or Facebook Groups, etc.). We will identify the communities where our prospective customers actively participate. For example, if we’re targeting software product managers, there are Slack communities and forums for product management. We can post a short call for volunteers (if allowed by the community rules) or directly message individuals who have discussed relevant topics. One startup founder found success by engaging with users via Slack – since his target customers were already on Slack, he would start an asynchronous conversation in Slack DMs, which often led to a quick call when the user was receptive
jeffgothelf.com
. This casual approach can “break the ice” on the user’s terms and dramatically increase conversion to scheduled interviews
jeffgothelf.com
. We will adopt similar creative tactics: meet customers where they are, and use the mediums they prefer.

Content Marketing & Thought Leadership: Another way to reach customers is to attract them to us. We can write brief articles or posts about the problem area on LinkedIn, Medium, or industry blogs. By sharing insights or questions about the pain point, we might catch the attention of people suffering that pain. Steven Cohn used this approach by writing compelling LinkedIn content to draw in his target audience, then reaching out to those who engaged (liked or commented) on his posts to ask for their thoughts
jeffgothelf.com
. This method generates warm leads – people who have essentially self-identified as interested in the problem – making them more likely to agree to a discussion. We should consider doing a short post (or even a survey) on social media asking “Does anyone else struggle with [X]? I’m researching solutions and would love to chat.” Even a handful of responses can lead to great interviews. Over time, building a small community or following around our mission (e.g. a Twitter account or LinkedIn page for our project) could give us ongoing access to user feedback.

Events, Meetups and Calls for Feedback: We will attend webinars, virtual conferences, or local meetups relevant to our industry and target users. These events often have networking opportunities or chat boxes where we can mention we’re working on solving [X problem] and are happy to talk to anyone who’s interested. For example, at a virtual conference we can drop a message like: “We’re researching [problem]. If you’re facing this and can spare 15 minutes to share your experience, please reach out – it would help us build a better solution.” Even asking in a webinar chat for volunteers for a short research call can get some responses
blog.squadra.vc
. We should also keep an eye out for people publicly complaining about the problem (on Twitter, Reddit posts, blog comments) – those are prime candidates to contact. Essentially, go where our potential users already are, and invite them into a conversation.

Across all these channels, our outreach will be polite, concise, and focused on learning about their needs. We’ll likely need to reach out to a large number of people to get our desired number of interviews (it’s normal if only 1 in 5 or 1 in 10 cold contacts agree to talk). We will track our outreach in a spreadsheet and note who has responded or scheduled a call. This persistence and organization will pay off as we steadily build up our knowledge base of customer pain points.

Pro tip: We will also ask every interviewee at the end, “Do you know anyone else who might have similar challenges that I could talk to?”. A referral from a happy interviewee can lead to another valuable contact. This way, our pool of contacts can grow virally through word-of-mouth.

Using Insights to Build a Landing Page & Waitlist

All the understanding we gain will directly inform both our product strategy and our marketing approach. Once we’ve spoken to a good number of customers and identified the most critical problem to solve, we will:

Define Our Value Proposition Clearly: By now we should be able to articulate in one compelling sentence who our product is for and what pain point it solves. For example: “A platform for freelance designers to easily manage client feedback, eliminating the chaotic email threads and saving hours each week.” (Hypothetical example.) This statement should reflect the real customer and real pain we uncovered. We’ll ensure it addresses the specific challenge our target users face, in their language. If we use our customers’ own words from interviews, our message will resonate strongly. Remember, at this stage we are effectively testing marketing messaging as well – buyers respond when you speak directly to their pain and how you solve it
prefinery.com
.

Create a Compelling Landing Page: With a clear value proposition, we will build a landing page as our startup’s initial web presence. This page will be simple but professional – think of it as our digital elevator pitch. Key elements to include:

A clear headline that highlights the core benefit or solution (focused on the pain point). For example, “Take the pain out of [Problem] for [Customer]” or “Finally, a better way to [solve X].” The headline should immediately tell a visitor what problem we solve for whom
prefinery.com
.

A brief description or bullet points elaborating on how our solution works or what value it provides. This will directly tie to the pain points we identified. (E.g. “Our platform automates ____, so you no longer have to ____.”)

Social proof or credibility boosters if available – since we’re early, this could be a testimonial from a pilot user (if we have one later) or simply a mention like “Built by a team of [experts in domain]” or referencing our own passion/experience with the problem. Anything that builds trust is helpful.

A prominent call-to-action (CTA) – likely a signup form for the waitlist. We’ll have an email capture form inviting users to “Join the Waitlist” or “Get Early Access”. We will keep this form minimal (just email, maybe name) to reduce friction
prefinery.com
. The CTA button should be eye-catching and present in a convenient spot (possibly even sticking as the user scrolls)
prefinery.com
.

Our landing page should be mobile-friendly and quick to load, since many visitors may come from mobile devices
prefinery.com
. We want the page to leave a strong impression that this product is solving your problem. The messaging will be refined using the exact phrases and pain descriptions we heard from our interviews.

Launch a Waitlist for Early Adopters: We will set up a waitlist for people interested in our product. This is typically just an email list that we gather via the landing page. The waitlist serves multiple purposes: it allows us to gauge the level of interest (how many sign-ups do we get?), it creates a sense of exclusivity and anticipation (people sign up to “be the first to know” or to get early access), and it gives us a ready pool of users to beta-test or launch to when the product is ready
prefinery.com
. In short, a waitlist helps confirm demand and generates buzz even before launch
prefinery.com
. We might even incorporate incentives to encourage sign-ups or referrals, such as “sign up now to get an early-bird discount” or referral rewards (though we’ll keep it simple to start). The main goal is to convert the interest we’ve cultivated through conversations into a tangible list of potential early adopters.

Stay Engaged with Interested Users: As people join the waitlist, we won’t go silent on them. We can send periodic updates or valuable content so they remain interested. For example, a monthly email sharing progress, asking a quick question, or giving a sneak peek of a feature. This keeps early adopters warm. (They’ll feel like they are part of the product’s journey, not just waiting in a void.) Building this community vibe can turn early users into our advocates. We may even invite some highly interested folks from our interviews to a private Slack or forum to engage more deeply. By launch time, we could have a group of fans rooting for us.

Develop the MVP Focused on the Core Problem: Finally, based on everything we learned, we will start developing our solution – but only the most crucial features that directly solve the core pain point. The research will have told us exactly what users must have and what they can live without initially. For example, if the core pain is “too much manual data entry,” then the MVP will focus on automation of data entry above all else. We’ll resist feature creep and nice-to-haves in this first version. The mantra is to solve the primary pain point exceptionally well. This ensures that when we do onboard those early users from our waitlist, they actually get the value we promised. Their feedback on the MVP will then guide us on what to build next. Essentially, our early customer research de-risks the development – we are building with a known customer need in mind, not in a vacuum.

Iterate Based on Feedback: After we have a basic product and some early users, the process comes full circle: we’ll continue to talk to users, gather feedback, and refine both the product and our understanding of customer needs. Customer discovery is not a one-time task but an ongoing practice. The insights from our initial research will set the foundation (from marketing messages to feature priorities), but continuous learning will help us reach product-market fit. By investing this time up front in understanding our customers, we are much more likely to build something people truly want and love. In fact, diligently interviewing customers now for a month or two can propel us forward faster later – it’s laying the groundwork for a product that can genuinely change our customers’ lives and set us up for a strong launch

.

Conclusion

In summary, our plan is to double down on understanding our customers before writing significant code. We’ll identify exactly who they are (even if it’s “both” of two groups, we’ll map them out), uncover their deepest pain points, and figure out how to best reach them (from cold calls to DMs and beyond). We will use every channel at our disposal to connect with early adopters and conduct interviews, treating each conversation as a treasure trove of insight. The findings will directly shape our product’s direction and our marketing messaging.

Armed with this knowledge, we’ll craft a compelling landing page that speaks to the customer’s pain and presents our solution as the remedy, and we’ll build a waitlist of interested users. This approach not only helps validate that there is a real market need, but also creates an initial community of supporters excited for our solution’s launch
prefinery.com
. By focusing development on the most crucial problem they face, we increase our chances of early adoption and success.

Ultimately, this thorough customer research and early outreach is an investment that will save us time, money, and heartbreak. It ensures that as we move forward, we’re not just building a product in isolation – we’re building the right product for the right customers, to solve the right problem. That alignment is the key to launching a product that gains traction quickly and sustainably. We’re not just guessing what our users need; we’ll know, because they’ve told us in their own words. Now, it’s our job to listen, learn, and deliver a solution that truly makes a difference for them.
