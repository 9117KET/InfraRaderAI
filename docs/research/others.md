4) Exact pain points to probe (and to lead with)

Data centers:

“We miss early site intel & credible project trackers across EA/MENA” → need early discovery & verification (permits, power, fiber).

“Power/project risk is opaque” → need PPA visibility, grid constraints, time-to-power, satellite progress checks.

“Too many sources; no one gives us a single source of truth with provenance” → need confidence scoring + evidence.

Renewable developers (selling PPAs to DCs/hyperscalers):

“Hard to find anchor data center loads and upcoming DC campuses” → need DC pipeline + energy load forecasts.

“Delays at grid/permits” → need risk signals & milestone tracking to prioritize bids.

Investors/DFIs:

“Sparse, fragmented intel to diligence digital+energy projects” → need verified pipeline + risk/viability scoring + stakeholder graph.

5) Outreach—who to DM/email & scripts
A) First-touch LinkedIn DM (20–30% acceptance if personalized)

Hi {FirstName}, I’m co-founding a platform that uses AI agents + geospatial signals to discover, verify and track data center & renewable projects across East Africa & MENA.
Teams like yours often tell us they lack early, verified intel (permits, power, fiber, counterparties) with confidence scores.
Would you be open to a 12-minute call to see if our private beta could save your team time on pipeline & due diligence?
– {YourName} | {One-line credibility—ex-ABiQ / prior clients}

Target roles per firm:

Khazna / Equinix / center3 / Raxio / IXAfrica / PAIX: Head of Development, Power & Sustainability, Interconnection, Strategy.

ACWA / AMEA / Masdar / ENGIE: Head of Origination/BD, Country Managers, Storage.

IFC / Africa50 / AFC: Digital Infra Investment Lead / Project Dev.

B) Follow-up email (if no DM reply in 3–5 days)

Subject: Early, verified DC + renewables pipeline in EA/MENA
Body:

Hi {Name},
We’re mapping every DC campus + linked renewable PPAs in EA/MENA, with evidence & confidence scores (news, tenders, permits, imagery).
If seeing early signals (e.g., site selection, power constraints, funding milestones) helps your team, could we share a 5-min demo reel + shortlist relevant to {Company}?
Best, {YourName} – {Role}, {Startup} | {site/LinkedIn}

C) Event playbook (DCD / AEF / GITEX)

Pre-book 6–10 meetings using attendee lists/speakers; message: “We link DC sites ↔ PPA projects with verification; 10-minute desk demo on iPad.”

Bring one A4 leave-behind: map screenshot + 3 watchlist examples + one satellite verification snippet (real names blurred).

(Add 5–10 local EPCs per country once you start interviews; they often surface hidden projects + intros.)

7) What to offer in the first call (to secure pilots)

A mini “watchlist” built for them: 10–20 projects (DC sites + nearby renewables) with: stage, power constraints, counterparties, evidence links, and confidence scores.

One visual teaser: A map view + 2 timeline screenshots + 1 satellite change detection (blurred).

A 30-day pilot promise: “We’ll maintain freshness <14 days on your watchlist; you’ll get alerts + exports; optional Salesforce/HubSpot CSV.”

If they bite: propose a paid pilot at a token amount to validate value (e.g., €3–5k/quarter for 5 users).

8) Tooling & tactics to speed this up (ethical + scrappy)

LinkedIn Sales Navigator for filtered roles/titles by region; save leads per company.

Hunter.io / Clearbit to guess email formats when not public; verify with NeverBounce.

Press rooms / Newsrooms (above) → get comms contacts, request BD/strategy intro.

Events: book meetings 2–3 weeks ahead; message speakers/panelists with the DM above referencing their session title.

Warm intros: Ask DFIs (IFC, Africa50, AFC) for introductions to their DC portfolio teams—they want better monitoring too.

Assemble a prototype watchlist (10–20 items) for 2 targets (one DC operator, one renewable developer) from the sources above; use it as your demo promise.

Convert 2–3 to pilots with a concrete freshness SLA and exports.

If you’d like, I can spin this into a CSV/Google Sheet with columns: Company | Region | Why now | Target Roles | LinkedIn search string | Event to meet | Source link so your team can work it line-by-line.
