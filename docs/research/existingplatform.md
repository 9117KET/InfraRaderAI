Yes — there are several existing platforms, firms, reports, research projects, etc., that are doing something similar (or parts of what you want) to your business-intelligence idea for global infrastructure/construction projects. Some cover a few of the features you plan, others are good inspiration or competitors. I’ll list them with strengths & gaps versus your vision.

1. Existing Players / Competitors
Name	What they do that's similar	Gaps vs what you want (AI + visualization + full pipeline)
Taiyō.AI	A platform aggregating & standardizing thousands of global infrastructure data sources to inform opportunities, risks etc. 
taiyo.ai
+1
	Might not yet have full automation with AI agents, especially verification via satellite or truly custom visualization / predictive modeling. UI/UX, transparency, verification details may be more limited.
Fitch Solutions – Infrastructure Key Projects Data	Huge database of 40,000+ infrastructure/construction projects globally. Has risk metrics, status, sector, geography, etc. 
Fitch Solutions
	Likely more static, less “real-time” or less automated AI verification; likely less visual/dynamic in terms of satellite imagery, comparative analytics or dashboard interactivity.
Infralogic	Provides real-time alerts and data on live deals, future transactions and market intelligence; profiling industry participants. 
Infralogic
	Probably focuses more on the finance / deal side; less on visual progress tracking; maybe less robust in verifying status via alternate data or providing deep predictive analytics.
Building Radar	Uses global construction project data + AI to help manufacturers & suppliers track developments, prioritize leads, identify decision-makers. 
buildingradar.com
	More oriented toward sales / supplier side rather than full project verification, mapping, stakeholder networks, or predictive timelines. Less emphasis (publicly) on visual progress tracking (e.g. via satellite).
Sitetracker	Platform for managing critical infrastructure — planning, building, operating & maintaining with analytics and workflows. 
Sitetracker
	More focused on asset lifecycle / project management for known projects; less about discovering new projects globally, verifying via external sources, or global monitoring from news / satellite.
Project / Construction PM Tools (Procore, Buildertrend, etc.)	These help with scheduling, cost tracking, onsite management etc. Useful for execution. 
Mercator.ai
+1
	These do not generally focus on project discovery, global pipeline, cross-source verification, geospatial mapping beyond onsite, or predictive analytics in the way you outline.
2. Research / Academic Projects

OGNet — creating a global oil & gas infrastructure database using remote imagery + deep learning. 
arXiv

SpaceNet / Multi-Temporal Urban Development Datasets — focused on detecting building construction vs. demolition via satellite/remote sensing. Useful pieces of what you want. 
arXiv

These show that tech exists (or is under development) for e.g. detecting physical infrastructure development, even in remote places, via imagery + AI. But such research tends to be more narrowly scoped, less productionized, and less integrated with e.g. market / financial / stakeholder data.

3. Strengths / What You Can Learn From Them

Data depth & breadth: Companies like Fitch & Taiyō already cover many projects, countries, sectors. Valuable to see how they source, normalize, and categorize.

Alerts & lead tools: Infralogic, Building Radar, etc. provide early-warning / lead generation tools.

Lifecycle & asset management: Sitetracker shows what’s possible for project execution, operations, maintenance.

Remote sensing / satellite / imagery analytics: OGNet etc. show how to detect physical changes.

4. Gaps / Opportunities Your Idea Can Exploit

From what’s out there, your idea can excel by closing these gaps:

Full pipeline automation: Discovery → profiling → verification → status tracking → predictions, all with AI agents. Many current tools do some but not all.

Verification via alternate data: Satellite imagery, remote sensing, maybe drone / IoT if possible. Cross-checking public data, news, images to reduce false positives / stale info.

Visualization & UI experience: Interactive, dynamic dashboards, geospatial visualizations, stakeholder network graphs, progress timelines, maybe even 3D or digital twin integration.

Predictive analytics: Forecast project delays, budget overruns, likelihood of project cancellation, etc.

Transparency & trust scoring: Indicating how confident the data is, source attribution, maybe community reporting / crowdsourced verification.

Real­-time or near real-time updates, especially for early stages (permits, bidding, land acquisition) before “projects” are officially announced.
