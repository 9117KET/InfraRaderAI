Who Is Your Customer?

One of the first and most important questions for any startup is identifying who your customer is. In practice, this means clearly defining the target market or segment that will most benefit from your product or service. Rather than trying to sell to “everyone,” successful startups focus on a specific customer segment or niche where they have the best chance of success
mitsloan.mit.edu
mitsloan.mit.edu
. As MIT entrepreneurship expert Bill Aulet advises, you should brainstorm all potential end-users of your idea, then select a primary “beachhead” market – a segment that’s small and focused enough that you can dominate it, yet significant enough to matter
mitsloan.mit.edu
mitsloan.mit.edu
. With limited resources, a startup must concentrate on the most promising customer profile.

To identify this ideal customer, founders often conduct primary market research to develop a detailed demographic and psychographic profile of their end user
mitsloan.mit.edu
. In other words, get to know your prospective customers’ characteristics, needs, and behaviors through interviews, surveys, or observation. Quantify the opportunity by estimating the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for your chosen segment – ensuring it’s not too broad or too narrow by calculating how much revenue you’d earn if you captured 100% of that market
mitsloan.mit.edu
. This analysis helps validate that your target segment is worthwhile.

A practical technique is to create a customer persona: a fictitious but data-driven profile representing your ideal customer. Aulet suggests identifying one real person who exemplifies your target end user and using them as a “persona” to focus your efforts
mitsloan.mit.edu
. Give this persona a name and specifics (age, occupation, goals, pain points) – this makes the customer tangible to you and your team. Once you have a primary persona, list out the next 10 potential customers who would fit that profile; if you struggle to find them, you may need to refine your definition
mitsloan.mit.edu
. By validating that there are multiple real individuals or organizations with the same profile and problem, you gain confidence that a market exists for your product.

In summary, knowing your customer means pinpointing the segment of people (or businesses) who have the problem you aim to solve, focusing in on a representative persona, and deeply understanding their needs and preferences. This focus will guide everything from product features to marketing strategy. As a startup, don’t try to be everything to everyone at first – become invaluable to your specific customer base and build from there
mitsloan.mit.edu
.

Understanding the Customer Journey

Having identified who your customer is, the next step is understanding how they interact with your product or service – in other words, knowing your customer journey. The customer journey is the complete series of steps a customer goes through in discovering, considering, purchasing, and using a product, including their motivations and feelings at each stage. Mapping out this journey helps you see your business from the customer’s perspective and spot opportunities to improve their experience.

In its simplest form, customer journey mapping involves outlining the user’s goals and actions in chronological order, then layering in their thoughts and emotions at each step
nngroup.com
. The result is often visualized as a timeline or diagram that tells the story of the customer’s experience from start to finish. For example, a typical journey might include stages like: Awareness (how the customer first learns about your product), Consideration (researching and comparing options), Decision/Purchase, Onboarding (initial use of the product), and Retention (continued use or repeat purchase). By fleshing out these stages with what the user is doing, thinking, and feeling, you create a narrative of their experience
nngroup.com
.

The value of mapping the customer journey is that it creates a shared vision of the customer’s experience for your team
nngroup.com
. It forces you to think outside-in (from the user’s viewpoint) rather than inside-out (from the company’s viewpoint). Often, businesses are organized in silos and each team only sees one part of the user’s experience. A journey map breaks those silos by illustrating how all the touchpoints connect from the customer’s angle
nngroup.com
. This makes it easier to identify pain points – moments where the customer might face frustration, confusion, or unmet needs – and then address them. For instance, you might discover that after a customer signs up on your website (consideration to decision stage), they don’t get enough guidance on how to use the service (onboarding stage), leading to drop-off. Recognizing that gap allows you to fix it (maybe by adding a tutorial or customer support follow-up).

When mapping a customer journey, it’s important to focus on a specific persona and scenario to keep it from becoming too generic
atlassian.com
. You might say, “Let’s map the journey of Alice, a busy graduate student (our persona), trying to use our app to organize her research (the scenario).” By staying specific, you gain more insight. Use research like customer interviews or surveys to ground the map in reality – find out actual customer motivations and pain points. The process often reveals not just what customers do, but why they do it and how they feel at each step.

Ultimately, understanding your customer journey helps you design better products and processes. It highlights critical moments of truth where you could impress the customer (or lose them). It also helps ensure a consistent and positive experience across all channels (online, in-person, etc.). For a startup, this is key to turning early adopters into happy, loyal customers. In the First Customer Journey program, you’ll learn to ask “What does my customer’s experience look like, from first hearing about my solution all the way to becoming a satisfied user?” – and by answering that, you can align your business to meet the customer’s needs at every step.

Designing Your Pricing

Pricing a new product or service is often challenging for founders. How do you design a pricing strategy that attracts customers but also sustains your business? There is no one-size-fits-all answer, but understanding common pricing approaches and the rationale behind them will help you set and adjust prices wisely.

Some fundamental pricing strategies include cost-based pricing, value-based pricing, and competition-based pricing
startupsavant.com
:

Cost-Based Pricing: Calculate all the costs of delivering your product (manufacturing, development, operations, etc.) and add a markup on top for profit. For example, a cost-plus strategy might take the unit cost and add, say, a 20% margin. This ensures you cover costs, but it doesn’t directly account for customer demand or willingness to pay.

Value-Based Pricing: Set the price primarily according to the perceived value to the customer rather than the cost. This requires understanding how much benefit or pain relief your solution provides, and what that is worth to your target customers
startupsavant.com
. For instance, if your software saves a company $10,000 a year in expenses, pricing it at a fraction of that (say $2,000) could be justified by value. Value-based pricing often involves customer research to gauge what people would be willing to pay for the benefits you offer
startupsavant.com
.

Competition-Based Pricing: Look at the prices of competing products or substitutes in the market and price yours accordingly
startupsavant.com
. If your offering is higher quality or has more features, you might price it above the competition; if you’re trying to enter a crowded market, you might price slightly lower to entice switchers. Just be careful not to undervalue your product or start a price war – use competitor prices as a benchmark, combined with your value proposition.

Early-stage startups sometimes adopt special pricing tactics to break into the market:

Penetration Pricing: Offering an initially low price (or heavy discounts) to attract early customers and gain market share quickly
startupsavant.com
. The idea is to lower the barrier for trial, get users on board, and later, once you’ve built a customer base or added more features, you can raise prices or upsell. This is common with new apps or services that offer free or cheap introductory plans.

Price Skimming: The opposite of penetration – start with a high price targeting early adopters who are willing to pay a premium, and then gradually lower the price over time to reach broader markets
startupsavant.com
. Tech gadgets often do this: early versions are expensive (capturing enthusiasts), and later models or after a period, the price drops to attract more price-sensitive customers.

Freemium Model: Especially in software/SaaS, offering a basic version for free while charging for advanced features or capacity is a popular strategy
startupsavant.com
. This way, you build a user base quickly through the free tier, then monetize the portion of users who need or want the premium features. It’s crucial to find the right balance of what to include for free versus paid.

Bundle Pricing: If you have multiple products or services, you can bundle them together at a combined price that’s lower than buying separately
startupsavant.com
. Bundling can increase the perceived value and encourage customers to spend more to get the “package deal.”

When designing your pricing, consider your goals and context. Do you need to maximize revenue per customer from day one (perhaps because you have high costs or low margins)? Or is it more important to get as many users as possible quickly (to gain network effects or market share)? Also, know your customer: for instance, students and startups have tight budgets, so a low entry price or free tier might be crucial in that market, whereas enterprise clients expect to pay and might equate a higher price with higher quality.

Importantly, pricing is not set in stone – it should be revisited as you learn. Stay flexible and be willing to adapt your pricing strategy over time
startupsavant.com
. Early on, you might even talk individually to customers to figure out their willingness to pay. Ensure you’re also tracking how pricing changes affect customer acquisition and retention. For a startup, finding the right price often involves some experimentation, but by starting with these core strategies (cost, value, competition) and aligning with your business strategy, you can make an educated initial guess and refine from there.

Designing Your Sales Process

A great product and a good price won’t get you far if you don’t have a way to systematically sell it. Designing a sales process means laying out the repeatable steps to turn an interested prospect into a paying customer. In a startup, the founder often wears the salesperson hat initially, and building a simple, clear sales pipeline is key to closing your first deals (and many more after).

A typical sales process can be visualized as a pipeline with stages such as: Prospecting → Qualifying → Presenting (or Pitching) → Negotiating → Closing
saastr.com
saastr.com
. Here’s what each stage entails:

Prospecting: This is about lead generation – identifying potential customers who might have the problem you solve. For a startup, prospecting could involve researching online for companies or individuals in your target segment, networking at events, or using platforms like LinkedIn. The goal is to create a list of prospects to approach
saastr.com
.

Qualifying: Not every prospect is a good or ready customer. Qualifying means determining which leads have a real need for your solution, the authority and ability to buy, and are within your target segment. In this stage, you might have an initial conversation or send a questionnaire to learn about the prospect’s situation
saastr.com
. Key questions: Do they have the problem I solve? Do they have budget? Is the decision-maker involved? This stage prevents wasting time on leads that are unlikely to convert
saastr.com
.

Presenting (Quoting): Now you formally present your value proposition to the qualified prospect – often through a product demo or a pitch meeting. This is where you propose a solution, highlighting how your product meets the prospect’s needs. In many cases it includes providing a quote or proposal that covers the solution details, pricing, and terms
saastr.com
. It’s crucial here to tailor the presentation to what the customer cares about (as learned in qualification).

Negotiating (Contracting): After the proposal, the ball is often in the customer’s court to consider and perhaps negotiate. They might have objections or requests (e.g. price adjustments, feature requirements, different payment terms). This stage involves addressing any final concerns and reaching a mutually acceptable agreement
saastr.com
. For a simple product, this might be quick; for a bigger deal, it could involve legal contract reviews, etc. Being responsive and solution-oriented here helps maintain momentum.

Closing (Won/Lost): This is the outcome stage – either the prospect agrees and signs the contract/makes the payment (deal won), or they decide not to proceed (deal lost)
saastr.com
. If won, you move on to onboarding the customer; if lost, it’s valuable to learn why (no budget, decided to stick with status quo, chose competitor, etc.) – that feedback can improve your sales approach for the future.

Implementing a defined sales process has several benefits. First, it gives you a pipeline view – you can track how many deals are in each stage and gauge your near-future revenue and progress
saastr.com
. For example, you might see you have 10 prospects, 5 qualified leads, 3 proposals out, and 2 deals about to close. This helps with forecasting and identifying where bottlenecks are (e.g., plenty of leads but not converting to qualified – maybe your targeting needs adjustment, or many proposals sent but few closed – maybe your pricing or proposal needs work). Second, it enforces a level of consistency and organization. Even if you’re a one-person team now, documenting your sales stages and steps will make it easier to onboard others later and ensure everyone handles leads similarly.

For startups, another big aspect of sales process design is deciding between inbound vs outbound sales, or a mix. Inbound means customers come to you (through marketing, referrals, etc.), and your process might start when they sign up on your website or contact you. Outbound means you actively reach out (cold emails, calls). Early on, many startups rely on outbound sales since nobody knows them yet – founder-led sales where you personally reach out to potential customers is common
close.com
close.com
. Over time, as marketing ramps up, you may catch interest inbound too. It’s good to be clear about your approach so you can optimize it: e.g., if doing outbound, perhaps dedicate time each week to prospecting and follow-up; if inbound, make sure you respond to inquiries quickly and nurture them.

Additionally, lead qualification is worth highlighting – it’s better to have 5 highly interested, good-fit leads than 50 random ones. Qualifying leads (often using criteria like BANT: Budget, Authority, Need, Timeline) ensures you focus your energy on those most likely to convert
saastr.com
saastr.com
. This ties back to knowing your customer – if you defined your target well, qualifying becomes easier.

Lastly, regularly evaluate and refine your sales process. As you get feedback, you might realize you need an extra touchpoint (maybe a follow-up call between presentation and closing), or you might streamline by automating an email after someone signs up. The program’s topic “How to design your sales process” will likely provide templates or frameworks for a basic pipeline. The key takeaway is to be deliberate: even a simple sales process plan is better than a chaotic, ad-hoc approach. It will help you stay on top of opportunities and not drop the ball as you work to land those first customers.

Presenting Your Idea

Being able to compellingly present your idea – whether to potential customers, partners, or investors – is a critical entrepreneurial skill. This is about pitching: communicating your business idea’s value in a clear, engaging way that persuades the listener. In the context of finding your first customers, presenting your idea well can make the difference between intrigue and indifference.

A few key principles for an effective pitch or presentation:

Start Strong and Clear: You have a very short window to hook your audience. Seasoned investors say they often gauge a pitch within the first 30 seconds
insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu
. Even with customers, attention is limited. Begin with a concise value proposition – a one-liner that states who your product is for and what problem it solves, in plain language. Cut to the chase instead of beating around the bush
insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu
. For example, “Our product helps [target customer] solve [X problem] by [your solution].” In those first moments, the listener should grasp your domain, the need, and your offering. This clarity allows them to relax and pay attention, rather than spend minutes confused about what you’re actually proposing
insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu
.

Tell a Story: Humans are wired to respond to stories. Try to frame your idea in a narrative that highlights a problem and solution. For instance, describe a relatable situation or a customer persona’s pain point, then show how your idea provides relief. A quick anecdote or scenario can emotionally engage the audience. One approach is the Problem-Agitate-Solution format: describe the problem (and why it’s painful), agitate by elaborating the difficulties if it’s not solved, then present your solution as the hero of the story. Storytelling not only makes your pitch memorable but also helps the audience empathize with the problem and envision the value of your solution
ivmf.syracuse.edu
ivmf.syracuse.edu
.

Cover the Basics (the “Details” that matter): While you don’t want to overload with information, a good pitch should address the fundamental questions: What problem are you solving? How are you solving it? Who is it for? What’s the benefit or value? – essentially your value proposition, plus a hint at the market and business model. As one entrepreneurship guide puts it, your pitch must clearly explain the problem and how you solve it, and convince the audience that you can succeed in doing so
ivmf.syracuse.edu
. This usually means touching on the size of the opportunity (e.g., how many people have this problem), and why you (your team or approach) are capable of delivering the solution. For a customer sales pitch, you’d focus more on how it benefits them; for an investor pitch, you’d include how it makes money. But in both cases, clarity is key – avoid jargon and use concrete terms.

Show a Roadmap or Next Steps: Particularly if your idea is at an early stage, audiences (like accelerator judges or potential partners) want to know your plan. This doesn’t mean you need a 5-year financial projection in a customer pitch, but you should convey that you have a path forward. For example, “Next month we’re launching our beta, and within six months we aim to have 1,000 users and gather feedback to iterate.” This gives a sense of momentum and that you’re serious about execution. In an investor-oriented pitch, this “roadmap” might cover go-to-market strategy and how you plan to scale or use their investment. In a customer pitch, it might simply be a call-to-action – e.g., “We’d love for you to join our pilot program starting next month.”

Know Your Audience and Present Yourself Well: Adapting your pitch to who is listening is crucial. If you’re talking to a potential customer, emphasize the direct benefits to them, and perhaps skip the technical minutiae or investor-speak. If you’re pitching to an investor, they’ll want to hear about market opportunity, traction, and business model viability. No matter who it is, present yourself confidently and professionally – your own demeanor can inspire trust. This includes maintaining good body language, eye contact (if in person or on video), and speaking clearly and enthusiastically (but not so fast that it’s overwhelming). Essentially, you are part of the pitch. People often judge the presenter as much as the idea; if you come across as prepared and passionate, it adds credibility to your idea.

Keep It Focused and Concise: A common mistake is trying to say too much. A pitch is not a complete business plan. It’s an invitation for further discussion. So include the most important points that drive interest; leave out or save the finer details for Q&A or follow-up. For example, if pitching a product, you don’t need to describe every feature – just the key ones that deliver the main value. One guideline is to aim for an “elevator pitch” (30 seconds to 1 minute summary) that can expand into a longer pitch (5-10 minutes) as needed
insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu
. Practicing brevity helps ensure you articulate the essence without losing your audience in details. Remember, simplicity sells – as long as the core is compelling, people will ask for the details themselves.

During the First Customer Journey accelerator, when working on “How to present your idea,” you will likely refine your pitch through feedback and maybe even pitch in front of others. Take advantage of that by practicing different versions (elevator pitch, 5-minute pitch, etc.). The goal is to confidently communicate your idea such that listeners quickly grasp it and get excited about its potential. A great pitch sparks a conversation – whether that’s a customer saying “I want this,” or an investor saying “Tell me more.”

Closing the Deal

After pitching your solution and convincing a customer of its value, the final step is closing the deal – getting that first commitment or sale. “Closing” in sales refers to the moment the prospect agrees to buy, but it’s not just a single moment; it’s a process of guiding the prospect from interest to action. Many founders find this stage intimidating, but with the right approach, you can close deals without feeling pushy.

Timing and Readiness: A key aspect of closing is knowing when to ask for the sale. Ideally, you attempt to close when the customer has seen the value and most objections have been addressed. Look for buying signals – for example, if a prospect starts asking about pricing details, implementation, or delivery timelines, it’s a strong sign they’re considering saying yes
monday.com
monday.com
. Other signals could be the prospect nodding along, verbally expressing positive feedback, or asking about contract specifics. At that point, it’s appropriate to transition to closing. On the other hand, if the prospect still has major unresolved concerns, you need to clarify those first (otherwise trying to close will feel premature and could backfire). In the program’s sales role-play, you’ll practice reading these signals and knowing when to confidently pop the question: “So, shall we move forward?” or any variant of it.

Techniques (with a light touch): There are many classic sales closing techniques. The right one depends on the situation and your style, but the overarching principle is to make it easy and logical for the customer to say yes. For instance, one popular method is the Assumptive Close, where you act on the assumption that they’ve decided to buy: you might start discussing next steps like scheduling onboarding or delivery
monday.com
activatedscale.com
. For example: “Great, it sounds like this meets your needs. Would you prefer us to start setup this week or next week?” – a question like that implies the sale is happening, subtly prompting the client to agree if they have no objections. Another technique is creating a sense of urgency (sometimes called a “Now-or-Never Close”) by highlighting a time-sensitive incentive: “We have a promotion until Friday, so if we sign up now, you’ll get an extra month free”. This can motivate action, but use urgency honestly and sparingly – it should never feel like a trick or pressure if the deal isn’t truly time-bound
activatedscale.com
.

There’s also the Summary Close, where you recap the key benefits you’ve discussed, essentially reinforcing why the customer was interested: “So, to summarize, with our service you’ll save 5 hours a week on accounting, integrate all your data in one place, and have 24/7 support. Shall we go ahead and get you started?”
activatedscale.com
. Hearing the benefits again can reassure the buyer that saying yes is the right move. Other techniques include the Question Close (directly asking if they have any remaining concerns or if they’re ready to proceed)
activatedscale.com
, or offering Options (the Alternative Close: e.g., “Would you like the standard plan or the premium plan?” – giving a choice rather than a yes/no decision)
activatedscale.com
.

No matter the technique, the tone should be positive and confident, not desperate. Research consistently shows that effective closing is not about high-pressure tactics or clever tricks – it’s about reinforcing the value and helping the customer confidently reach a decision
activatedscale.com
. In fact, think of closing as a natural conclusion of a well-run sales process: if you’ve identified the right customer, understood their needs, explained your solution’s value, and addressed questions, closing is often a straightforward next step. Sometimes merely asking for the sale in a clear way is all that’s needed (e.g., “I can send over the agreement right now – are you ready to move forward?”).

Handling Objections and Staying Engaged: Even at the closing stage, a prospect might raise last-minute objections or hesitations (“I’m not sure about X feature” or “It’s a bit expensive” or “Can I think about it?”). It’s important to stay calm and see these as opportunities rather than rejections. A good approach is to acknowledge the concern and probe for more information: “I hear you – the price is a big consideration. Aside from price, is there anything else holding you back?”. This way, you ensure price is the only issue; if it is, maybe you can discuss value or ROI to justify it, offer a payment plan, or as a last resort, negotiate. If more issues come up, address them one by one. The key is to not shy away from a closing conversation just because of an objection; often, prospects bring up objections because they’re seriously considering buying and need that one last reassurance.

Additionally, be prepared to follow through. Closing isn’t just getting a verbal “yes”; it includes successfully getting the contract signed or payment processed. Make that step easy: have your proposal or contract ready to send quickly, use e-signature tools or a straightforward checkout process, and guide the customer through it. Until the deal is officially closed, continue to guide the prospect – for example, if they say “Yes, let’s do it,” respond with enthusiasm and confirm next steps (“Fantastic! I’ll email you the sign-up link right now, and once we get that done, we can schedule the kickoff call.”). This ensures the momentum carries through to an actual closed deal and sets the tone for your new customer’s experience.

In summary, closing the deal is about converting a willing prospect into a customer by using the right timing, maintaining trust, and clearly asking for their business. It’s the culmination of all your prior efforts in understanding the customer, demonstrating value, and pitching effectively. The First Customer Journey program’s focus on “how to close the deal” will likely give you practice with role-playing these scenarios. Remember, when done right, closing doesn’t feel like a high-pressure gamble; it feels like a natural, even exciting, next step for both you and the customer – you’re welcoming a new customer on board, and they’re gaining a solution to their problem. As one sales guide succinctly puts it: mastering the close is about understanding your customer’s needs and guiding them toward a confident “yes,” not about pressure or gimmicks

. With preparation and practice, you’ll be able to confidently ask for the sale and start building your venture’s early customer base.
