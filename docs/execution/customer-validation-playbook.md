# InfraRadar AI - Customer Validation Playbook

## Document Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive customer validation playbook for InfraRadar AI, including interview frameworks, pilot customer criteria, success metrics, and validation methodologies. The playbook ensures we validate our key assumptions through systematic customer research.

## Executive Summary

Our customer validation strategy targets 100 customer interviews over 90 days, focusing on MENA data center and renewable energy professionals. We'll identify pilot customers, validate willingness to pay, and refine our product based on real customer needs.

**Core Principle**: Listen to customers, don't pitch to them. Let them tell us what they need, not what we think they need.
