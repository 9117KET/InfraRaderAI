## Satellite Imagery Cost Optimization

### Multi-Layered Geospatial Triage

#### Layer 1: Low-Resolution Screening

- **Source**: Sentinel-2 (free), Landsat (free), MODIS (free)
- **Cost**: $0 per km²
- **Use Case**: Initial project identification and screening
- **Coverage**: 100% of target areas
- **Update Frequency**: Weekly

#### Layer 2: Medium-Resolution Analysis

- **Source**: Planet Labs (PlanetScope), Airbus (SPOT)
- **Cost**: $2-5 per km²
- **Use Case**: Confirmed project analysis and monitoring
- **Coverage**: 20% of screened areas
- **Update Frequency**: Monthly

#### Layer 3: High-Resolution Verification

- **Source**: Maxar (WorldView), Airbus (Pleiades)
- **Cost**: $10-30 per km²
- **Use Case**: Detailed verification and analysis
- **Coverage**: 5% of confirmed projects
- **Update Frequency**: Quarterly

#### Cost Savings Calculation

```
Without Triage:
100% of projects × $20/km² = $20,000 per 1000 km²

With Triage:
100% × $0 (Layer 1) + 20% × $3 (Layer 2) + 5% × $20 (Layer 3)
= $0 + $600 + $1,000 = $1,600 per 1000 km²

Savings: 92% reduction in imagery costs
```
