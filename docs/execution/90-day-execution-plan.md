# InfraRadar AI - 90-Day Execution Plan

## Document Purpose

This document provides a detailed 90-day execution plan for InfraRadar AI, with weekly milestones, validation gates, and decision points. The plan focuses on achieving our kill criteria while building the foundation for scaling.

## Executive Summary

We have 90 days to prove that people will pay for fresh, verified, actionable infrastructure data. Our execution plan is divided into three phases: Foundation (Weeks 1-4), Validation (Weeks 5-8), and Optimization (Weeks 9-12), with clear kill criteria and pivot triggers.

**Core Principle**: Better to fail fast and pivot than to delude ourselves with vanity metrics.

## Conclusion

The 90-day execution plan provides a structured approach to validating our key assumptions while building a foundation for scaling. By focusing on kill criteria and maintaining discipline around pivot decisions, we can either find product-market fit quickly or pivot to something that works.

**Key Success Factors**:

1. **Discipline**: Stick to kill criteria, don't rationalize failures
2. **Focus**: Narrow wedge excellence before expansion
3. **Customer Value**: Immediate ROI through workflow integration
4. **Data Quality**: Human verification and confidence scoring
5. **Team Execution**: Hire right people, build right processes
