# InfraRadar AI - Pivot Scenarios

## Document Purpose

This document defines four pivot scenarios for InfraRadar AI, providing decision criteria and implementation plans for each pivot option. These scenarios ensure we have clear paths forward if our current strategy doesn't achieve our kill criteria.

## Executive Summary

If we miss our 90-day kill criteria, we have four pivot options: consulting/services model, different vertical (transport), different geography, or data provider/API model. Each pivot has specific decision criteria, implementation plans, and success metrics.
