Recommendations for Outreach & Early Adoption

Prepare personalised briefs for each potential investor or supplier summarising how our AI‑powered platform will provide real‑time project discovery, verification and risk prediction. Highlight benefits such as reducing information asymmetry, improving due‑diligence efficiency and identifying financing gaps early.

Contact key Middle‑East investors (DP World, Alpha MBM, sovereign funds) and American investors/suppliers (Bechtel, DFC, Schlumberger) through official corporate emails or investor relations. Use available contact details (e.g., Afri Fund Capital’s contact
afrifundcapital.com
) to arrange calls.

Offer early‑adopter trials for large projects (e.g., LAPSSET, Lobito Corridor) to demonstrate the platform’s capabilities in tracking project milestones, verifying progress with satellite imagery and predicting delays. This builds trust and encourages investment.

Engage development banks & DFIs (AfDB, Islamic Development Bank, DFC) as partners; they finance multiple projects and could integrate the platform into their due‑diligence workflows. Show how AI agents can streamline their monitoring of funded projects.

Highlight unique value: Many African projects suffer from fragmented information and slow updates. Our solution’s AI agents will centralise data, track progress via multiple sources, and generate predictive analytics, which Middle‑Eastern and American investors need to make informed decisions.
