Why Data Centers + Renewables in EA/MENA is powerful

Explosive growth vertical

Hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, Google, Meta) are aggressively scouting Africa & MENA. Example: AWS announced a Cape Town expansion; Microsoft has in Nairobi; Google is in Qatar.

AI compute + cloud adoption ‚Üí massive demand for data centers, especially in energy-stable hubs (Kenya, Egypt, Morocco, UAE, Saudi).

Every new data center requires energy security, usually with a renewable PPA (solar/wind + backup).

Capital-intensive projects

A single DC build = $100M‚Äì$1B capex (comparable to utility-scale power plants).

Investors, EPCs, and suppliers are eager for intelligence.

Few competitors track them well

Fitch/BMI mention DCs in ‚Äúsocial infra‚Äù but no deep coverage.

ABiQ lumps them under ‚ÄúICT projects,‚Äù often missing key details.

No one is giving live DC pipeline data + energy linkage.

Natural synergy with your renewable wedge

Many DC projects are tied to solar/wind farms, microgrids, or special power arrangements.

Positioning: ‚ÄúWe track both the data center build and the power infra behind it.‚Äù That‚Äôs unique.

üöÄ How to frame the wedge

Pilot MVP scope:

Regions: East Africa (Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda, Egypt) + MENA (UAE, Saudi, Morocco).

Sectors: Renewable Energy (solar, wind, geothermal) + Data Centers (hyperscaler, colocation, gov-backed).

Data you‚Äôd track for DC projects:

Name, location, stage (announced, site selection, under construction, operational).

Capacity: MW IT load, floorspace, racks.

Sponsors: hyperscaler (AWS, MSFT, GCP), colocation (Equinix, Digital Realty, Africa Data Centres).

EPCs and contractors.

Power source/PPA (linked to renewables projects in same DB).

Financing (venture, PE, sovereign wealth, DFIs).

üõ°Ô∏è Why this makes you safer vs. ‚ÄúAI will kill you‚Äù

General AI won‚Äôt: They don‚Äôt know DC pipeline details unless scraped manually.

Data moat: Once you capture DC + renewable linkages (e.g. ‚ÄúThis 50 MW DC in Kenya is backed by a 70 MW solar farm in Kajiado‚Äù), it‚Äôs proprietary graph data.

Market timing: Infra + AI hype = investors LOVE anything that connects AI‚Äôs physical backbone (data centers) to climate-friendly energy.

üß≠ Go-to-Market Angle

Who pays first:

DC operators themselves (for competitor intelligence + supplier networks).

Hyperscalers‚Äô suppliers (cooling, fiber, power infra).

Renewable developers who want to win DC PPAs.

Investors looking to back ‚Äúdigital + green infra‚Äù in Africa/MENA.

Narrative to investors:

‚ÄúWe are building the Bloomberg Terminal for Africa/MENA‚Äôs AI & renewable infrastructure.
We track every new data center, the energy projects behind it, and the financing shaping both.‚Äù

Brutal honest take

‚úÖ Pursuing renewables alone is good ‚Üí but crowded (ABiQ, Fitch, multiple portals).
‚úÖ Adding data centers makes you 10√ó more differentiated:

Smaller number of projects ‚Üí easier to track deeply at MVP.

High-profile clients (AWS, Google, Equinix) ‚Üí easier to get attention.

Investors drool over ‚ÄúAI + infra + climate‚Äù ‚Üí great fundraising narrative.

‚ö†Ô∏è Only risk: Don‚Äôt overexpand too early (still choose 1‚Äì2 core geographies for MVP). But renewables + data centers in EA/MENA is the perfect wedge.

üëâ My advice: Yes, focus on both. Position your MVP as:

‚ÄúWe track renewable projects and data centers in East Africa and MENA‚Äîand map the connections between digital infra and the green power that runs it.‚Äù

Would you like me to update the canonical schema to explicitly handle Data Center projects (with fields like IT load, PUE, anchor tenants, PPA links to renewables)?

\section*{Executive Summary}
We propose to develop an \textbf{AI-powered business intelligence platform} dedicated to tracking, verifying, and visualizing \textbf{Data Center}, \textbf{Renewable Energy}, and \textbf{AI Infrastructure} projects across East Africa and the MENA region.  
Unlike existing legacy platforms, our solution will integrate modern AI agents, geospatial intelligence, and advanced visualization to provide real-time, actionable insights for investors, contractors, suppliers, and policymakers.  

\section{Background and Rationale}
The global shift towards digitalization, cloud adoption, and AI compute is creating unprecedented demand for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Centers} ‚Äì Hyperscalers (AWS, Microsoft, Google) and colocation providers (Equinix, Africa Data Centres) are rapidly expanding in Africa and MENA.
    \item \textbf{Renewable Energy Projects} ‚Äì To power this digital growth sustainably, large-scale solar, wind, and geothermal projects are being deployed to secure reliable, green energy supply.
    \item \textbf{AI Infrastructure} ‚Äì New clusters, high-performance computing centers, and edge facilities are under development to support AI workloads.
\end{itemize}

However, project data in these regions is \textit{fragmented, outdated, or unreliable}. Existing competitors (ABiQ, Fitch Solutions, Building Radar) rely on manual curation and legacy UIs, failing to leverage AI for discovery, verification, and predictive analytics.

\section{Problem Statement}
Stakeholders face the following pain points:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of \textbf{early visibility} into planned projects, leading to missed opportunities.
