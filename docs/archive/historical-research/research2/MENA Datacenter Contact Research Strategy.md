# **The GCC Digital Infrastructure Target Map: Identifying Contacts and Early Adopters in KSA and UAE (2025 Focus)**

## **I. Executive Summary and Strategic Action Overview**

### **A. The 2025 GCC Digital Real Estate Mandate: An Unprecedented Window of Opportunity**

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, particularly Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), is experiencing a structural economic transformation, shifting from nascent digital markets to internationally recognized digital hubs. This transition is not organic; it is driven by massive state-level commitment and sovereign capital deployment, creating a highly strategic window for specialized infrastructure firms to establish partnerships with early adopters.

The central force behind this transformation in KSA is the Vision 2030 strategy, which explicitly mandates economic diversification and regional leadership in technology.1 This mandate is underpinned by tangible financial commitment: Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) has committed a staggering $6 billion to develop one of the world's largest data center ecosystems.1 For the global data center industry, this investment raises the critical question of whether the Middle East is now poised to become the next major frontier for digital real estate development, leveraging its strategic location connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa via critical subsea cables.1 In the UAE, the focus is on ultra-large-scale specialized infrastructure, highlighted by the May 2025 launch of G42's Stargate UAE, a massive 5 GW AI cluster in Abu Dhabi.2

Outreach must be strategic, focusing specifically on projects actively receiving sovereign backing or those that represent complex, multi-billion-dollar international hyperscaler greenfield deployments. Targeting established, lower-growth operational assets should be avoided in favor of capturing high-growth, high-risk, early-stage opportunities currently mandated by national strategies.

### **B. High-Priority Target Matrix (Snapshot for Immediate Action)**

The analysis identifies four core profiles representing the highest priority for immediate engagement, categorized by their primary strategic driver:

1. **Sovereign AI/Specialization:** Entities like G42 and its sovereign backer ADQ, focused on the immediate operational needs of the 5 GW AI cluster, where power, cooling, and security requirements are unprecedented.2  
2. **Greenfield Hyperscale:** AWS and Microsoft, where the critical path is real estate site selection, due diligence, and utility security for new regional launches.3  
3. **Sovereign Mandate Execution:** PIF-catalyzed local capital vehicles, such as Alfanar (committed $1.4 billion in March 2025\) 2, who are under immense pressure to deliver rapidly to meet national deadlines.  
4. **Localized Specialization:** Developers like DataVolt (focused on Neom/Oxagon) and ICS Arabia, executing specific, localized, and technologically demanding AI-ready and edge computing infrastructure.3

### **C. The Core Value Proposition Pivot: From Cost to Certainty**

Successful cold outreach requires fundamentally shifting the conversation away from conventional price negotiation (cost) toward sophisticated risk mitigation (certainty). Project sponsors, particularly those managing large infrastructure funds and sovereign capital, are acutely aware that execution risks—specifically construction and design delays—translate directly into financial erosion.

A delay in construction or engineering design postpones the start of commercial operation, meaning expected future revenues are realized later, leading them to be "more heavily discounted and therefore having a lower present value".5 This direct reduction of the project’s Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is a primary concern for finance stakeholders. Therefore, specialized services that provide schedule certainty, comprehensive risk quantification 6, and robust project oversight are perceived not merely as operational expenses, but as investments critical to protecting the financial integrity and valuation of the project.

## **II. The Early Adoption Landscape: GCC Hyperscale Project Profiling**

This section provides a detailed catalog of the most significant active and upcoming digital infrastructure projects, which serve as the foundation for targeted contact identification.

### **A. Saudi Arabia (KSA): Vision 2030 Digitalization Accelerators**

KSA's strategy centers on leveraging its abundant, transitioning energy resources and its strategic physical location to capture a projected regional cloud growth of over 30% CAGR through 2028\.1

#### **1\. PIF-Backed Ecosystem Mandate and Strategic Partners**

The centerpiece of KSA’s digital roadmap is the $6 billion commitment from the Public Investment Fund (PIF).1 The PIF acts as the primary capital source, spurring substantial local private investment. For example, Alfanar announced a $1.4 billion commitment for Saudi data centers in March 2025\.2 The essential implication is that the PIF is not executing these projects directly; rather, it is funding selected local partners (such as Alfanar, and telecom giants STC and Tawal) to deliver the mandate. These local execution firms are consequently operating under intense pressure to achieve project milestones quickly and reliably to satisfy Vision 2030 deadlines. This heightened delivery pressure means these partners are highly sensitive to adopting specialized services—such as advanced project management oversight or stringent procurement systems—that guarantee project velocity and reliability. Direct communication with leaders in PIF's infrastructure or technology investment departments, or their closely affiliated local execution partners, is paramount.

#### **2\. Global Hyperscaler Greenfield Entries (AWS & Microsoft)**

Major global players are establishing deep roots in KSA. Amazon Web Services (AWS) announced plans for a new infrastructure region in Saudi Arabia in March 2024, and Microsoft has an upcoming facility slated for the Eastern Province.3 These are multi-billion-dollar greenfield developments. AWS mandates, specifically, necessitate extensive and rigorous due diligence for site identification, utility access, zoning compliance, and complex deal structuring, including leases or build-to-suit agreements.4 This demands that the Principal Real Estate Development Manager or equivalent lead is the critical internal stakeholder for any firm involved in environmental due diligence, utility negotiation, or site services. Success at this real estate phase unlocks the subsequent construction and procurement contracts.

#### **3\. Localized and Specialized Developers (Neom and Edge Computing)**

A separate layer of opportunity exists within specialized and localized projects. DataVolt is partnering with Neom on Phase 1 of a data center project in Oxagon, focused specifically on AI-ready infrastructure.3 Similarly, ICS Arabia is developing its Desert Dragon Data Centers across multiple locations (Al-Kharj, Jeddah, Dammam, Neom) 3, while Tawal and 5SKYE are developing distributed Edge AI Micro Data Centers.3 This fragmentation of projects across local developers implies multiple, parallel procurement cycles running simultaneously in different geographic centers (Riyadh, Jeddah, Neom). This structure broadens the contact base, allowing vendors to target Directors of Engineering and Construction within specific local execution firms, rather than being restricted to a centralized global procurement process.

### **B. United Arab Emirates (UAE): AI & Cloud Scale-Up**

The UAE’s digital infrastructure push is characterized by its focus on ultra-large-scale specialization and technological advancement, driven by powerful sovereign entities like ADQ and its digital conglomerate G42.2

#### **1\. The 5 GW AI Cluster: G42 Stargate**

The G42 launched Stargate UAE, an AI cluster with an astonishing 5 GW power capacity, in May 2025\.2 This is an unprecedented scale for an AI cluster, creating unique challenges in power supply, cooling innovation, and specialized security. The crucial constraint for this project lies in securing the necessary power infrastructure and project funding, rather than simply land availability. The sheer size of this development ties directly into the infrastructure commitments of ADQ, which joined Energy Capital Partners (ECP) for a $25 billion portfolio of power projects.2 Consequently, an inevitable delay in the power generation or interconnection is a project killer for the AI cluster. Outreach must therefore target executives managing the power generation and finance vehicles (ADQ and ECP partnership leads), acknowledging the symbiotic relationship between energy infrastructure and data cluster viability.

#### **2\. Hyperscaler/Telecom Collaboration**

The agreement between Microsoft and du for a $544 million UAE hyperscale facility, finalized in April 2025, presents a distinct structure.2 This joint venture arrangement necessitates complex governance and shared risk profiles. Vendors must successfully navigate two corporate cultures—a global hyperscaler and a local telecom entity. The shared decision-making inherent in this structure increases procurement complexity and the requirement for robust diligence. To achieve success, outreach should be conducted along a dual track, targeting both the Microsoft Procurement Director 8 and the equivalent partnership or infrastructure lead at du, where procurement decisions are likely scrutinized by both parties’ financial and legal teams, demanding best-in-class risk quantification services.6

## **III. Potential Contact Identification and Executive Archetypes**

Successful engagement hinges on identifying the specific executive function that holds ownership over the most acute project risk or controls the largest leverage point within the budget.

### **A. Real Estate & Development Stakeholders (The Site Acquisition Gatekeepers)**

The primary target here is the Principal Real Estate Development Manager, or the equivalent VP of Site Acquisition within AWS, Microsoft, or G42.4 This role is the initial gatekeeper for billions in capital deployment. Their critical areas of pressure include achieving flawless site identification, performing rigorous due diligence, negotiating favorable and complex build-to-suit or lease agreements, and securing utility access (power and water) in challenging or emerging zones like Neom.4

The fundamental challenge faced by this executive is that securing site access in the GCC is intrinsically linked to navigating local regulatory environments, building relationships with municipalities, and engaging economic development agencies.4 In the UAE, structural reforms have eased foreign ownership and bolstered corporate governance 7, but the complexities remain significant. The required value proposition must focus on solutions that drastically reduce the *time to site delivery*. Any firm engaging this archetype must position itself as a reliable intermediary familiar with the nuances of local engagement and globally aligned legal frameworks (such as the Abu Dhabi Global Market, ADGM, or the Dubai International Financial Centre, DIFC) 7, thereby de-risking the complex real estate mandate for global firms.

### **B. Procurement and Supply Chain Directors (The Cost and Efficiency Drivers)**

Targeting the Director of Procurement (as defined by roles at Microsoft 8) or the VP of Supply Chain Management at local developers (e.g., ICS Arabia) is essential for securing vendor inclusion. These executives are focused on managing massive capital outflows and executing robust procurement plans aligned with global business strategies.8 Their critical pain points revolve around ensuring supply chain certainty, developing compliant supplier ecosystems, and driving continuous process improvement.

A key strategic mandate for this role, as seen in global hyperscaler descriptions, is the explicit utilization of advanced technology, such as AI-supported tools or Copilot, to enhance procurement processes and drive better decision-making.8 Therefore, the required value proposition should not frame a firm's services purely as a commodity, but as an *innovative solution* that integrates seamlessly with this strategic mandate. The message must demonstrate how the service can leverage technology to upskill the client's procurement team and manage vendor risk effectively at the hyper-scale required for projects like the 5 GW Stargate cluster.2

### **C. Project Finance & Capital Sponsors (The Deal Structurers and Risk Assessors)**

This is the highest level of target, encompassing Partners and Directors at sovereign wealth funds (PIF, ADQ), managers of infrastructure funds (ECP), and senior investment bankers leading project finance (SNB Capital).1 Their primary focus is managing financial exposure. Pain points include mitigating the financial risk associated with construction delays (which sharply discount future revenues 5), structuring innovative finance mechanisms for co-investment with international firms 7, and navigating complex legal frameworks.

The market in the GCC is highly sophisticated, evidenced by local investment banks like SNB Capital actively leading local securities lending and developing bespoke derivative strategies.9 This financial sophistication demands an advisory approach that speaks the language of IRR, present value, and risk premiums. The successful outreach firm must offer the quantification of schedule certainty and risk mitigation using standardized frameworks.6 The target is not simply seeking finance; they are seeking advanced mechanisms—such as quantifying the monetary value of mitigating a 6-month delay—to make their high-stakes infrastructure investments more attractive to global co-investors.7 The value proposition must offer financial modeling expertise linked directly to physical project delivery metrics.

## **IV. Strategic Outreach Methodology and Messaging Hooks**

### **A. The Financial Imperative: Connecting Execution Risk to Valuation**

The most compelling outreach hook for senior project sponsors centers on the risk of IRR erosion. As detailed, construction schedule slippage postpones the expected revenues, resulting in lower present value and decreased project valuation.5 Any project financing deal, such such as Alfanar’s $1.4 billion investment 2, is underwritten by a detailed financial model. By positioning services as instruments that mitigate schedule risk, a firm offers to protect the integrity of the project's financial model, achieving a significantly higher perceived value than a simple construction or management contract.

To engage these financial leaders effectively, the value of risk mitigation must be standardized and objective. Risk quantification frameworks should be utilized, assigning numerical values using scales (e.g., 1 to 5 or 0% to 100%) to represent the probability and potential impact of risks (cost, schedule, quality).6 By transforming qualitative risk descriptions into quantifiable data, quantitative risk analysis is facilitated. Outreach should reference specific risk frameworks, offering to benchmark the client's current project portfolio against industry standards. This specialized focus on risk treatment aims to reduce the overall construction risk premium assigned to the project.5

### **B. Developing Hyper-Personalized Outreach Narratives**

Effective outreach, whether via cold email or LinkedIn, requires referencing specific activities, company roles, or relevant industry challenges.10 Given the scale of the GCC early adoption projects, the unique industry challenge (e.g., 5 GW power sourcing for G42, or the Neom regulatory environment) serves as a potent personalization hook.

Targeted Outreach Matrix: Role, Pain Point, and Value Proposition

| Executive Archetype | Primary Industry Pain Point (The Hook) | Strategic Objective for Outreach | Example Outreach Personalization | Source Citations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Principal Real Estate Development (AWS, G42) | Site selection complexity; Utility interconnection delays; Entitlement hurdles in new zones (KSA/Neom). | Offer solutions that accelerate site due diligence and secure complex utility arrangements, ensuring smooth site delivery. | Reference the critical need for long-term power/water alignment in the KSA AWS/Microsoft greenfield sites. | 3 |
| Director of Procurement (Microsoft, Alfanar) | Supply chain volatility; Need for compliant, innovative supplier ecosystem; Pressure to leverage technology (AI) for decision-making. | Position services as critical for achieving supply chain certainty and quality assurance at massive scale (e.g., 5 GW cluster). | Focus on leveraging AI/technology integration to enhance procurement decisions and manage vendor risk in large-scale KSA projects. | 2 |
| Project Finance Manager (PIF, ADQ, SNB Capital) | Construction schedule slippage eroding IRR and valuation (Present Value loss). | Offer risk quantification frameworks and schedule certainty advisory to protect the financial model and reduce construction risk premium. | Highlight the financial impact of construction delay on discounted revenues for their specific $1.4B or $6B mandated projects. | 1 |

### **C. Template Strategy: Pain Point-Based Outreach**

Outreach templates must be highly relevant and pivot immediately to the known executive pain point.11

1\. Template Focus (Targeting Project Finance/Sponsor): The Schedule Certainty and IRR Preservation  
This messaging targets the executive who holds responsibility for financial outcome and institutional reporting (PIF, ADQ, SNB Capital).

* *Subject Line:* "Protecting the PV of Project X: Mitigating Estimated $X,XXX,XXX in Delayed Revenue Risk."  
* *Body Hook:* "Considering the strategic importance and scale of the AWS KSA region launch 3, it is clear that construction delays—even minor ones—can lead to severe present value discounts on projected long-term revenues.5 Our methodology quantifies these specific risks using objective scales 6 and has been utilized by peers to reduce the construction risk premium by leveraging advanced schedule certainty metrics. We believe this expertise can directly support your mandate to ADQ/PIF for the 5 GW cluster."

2\. Template Focus (Targeting Real Estate/Development): The Site Acceleration  
This messaging targets the operational executive responsible for physical delivery and site readiness (AWS Principal Real Estate Development Manager, DataVolt VP).

* *Subject Line:* "Accelerating Entitlement for KSA Data Center Delivery.4"  
* *Body Hook:* "The primary bottleneck for hyperscale greenfield development in emerging regions is consistently the challenge of securing long-term power access and navigating complex zoning approvals.4 We specialize in local regulatory navigation and utility negotiation across multiple GCC jurisdictions. By addressing these factors, we are capable of significantly reducing the lead time required before the construction phase begins, directly supporting your Q2 2025 site delivery targets for the Neom or Eastern Province projects."

## **V. Recommendations and Next Steps**

### **A. Prioritized Contact Compilation and Initial Outreach**

The initial phase of contact compilation must prioritize roles that control the critical path and the greatest financial leverage:

1. **Phase I (High-Impact/Low Volume):** Target senior executives in Project Finance and Sponsorship. This includes partners or directors within PIF/ADQ/ECP, who manage the $6 billion PIF ecosystem 1 and the $25 billion ADQ/ECP power investment.2 The messaging should focus on the IRR/Risk Quantification narrative.  
2. **Phase II (High-Volume/Execution):** Target technical and execution leaders. The Principal Real Estate Development Manager or equivalent within AWS and Microsoft must be prioritized, as they are the first gatekeepers for billions in capital deployment.3 Simultaneously, target Directors of Procurement (Microsoft 8), DataVolt leads (Neom/Oxagon), and ICS Arabia leads (Desert Dragon) using site acceleration and supply chain certainty messaging.

### **B. Monitoring Framework and Future Opportunity Tracking**

Given the highly centralized and rapidly evolving nature of the GCC market, defined by strategic announcements like Alfanar's $1.4 billion commitment 2, continuous monitoring is essential to capture new opportunities immediately. Key areas for monitoring include:

* New strategic alliances announced by ADQ and PIF, similar to the ADQ/ECP power infrastructure partnership.7 These alliances reveal the immediate constraints the sovereigns are attempting to resolve.  
* New infrastructure development and project management contracts awarded by entities like NEOM/OXAGON, which will involve local execution developers such as DataVolt or international construction firms (like Turner International, whose leadership structure is active in the region 12).  
* Further developments in the local derivatives and financial markets, signaled by increased activity from local investment banks like SNB Capital 9, which may indicate a growing need for advanced financial risk hedging and structured products tied to infrastructure assets.

### **C. Refinement of Service Offering**

To maximize conversion rates in this expert-level market, the service offering must be explicitly framed in quantifiable financial metrics:

* The value proposition should move beyond operational descriptions. Instead of describing enhanced project management, the firm must state its service provides schedule certainty that reduces the project’s construction risk premium by a specific percentage, yielding a measurable improvement in the project’s forecast IRR.  
* When dealing with international co-investors seeking reassurance, the firm should utilize local market expertise regarding the globally aligned legal and regulatory frameworks, such as the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) or the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) 7, presenting this familiarity as a competitive differentiator that mitigates governance risk.
